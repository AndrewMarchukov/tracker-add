# Get more trackers

See no peers for some torrent(s)? Add more tracker(s) from Transmission

## Installation
* Download script and make it executable:
Edit settings for transmission set rpc-enabled, rpc-username and rpc-password
```

```

## Usage


Don't be confused with `failed` message. In most cases, it means tracker(s) already added and/or exists in current torrent.
